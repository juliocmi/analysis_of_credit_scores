# 📊 Credit Scoring Analytics – Banking Credit Risk Analysis

## 📌 Executive Summary

This project focuses on **credit scoring data analysis within a banking context**, aiming to assess the credit risk of potential customers using financial, demographic, and behavioral variables. The analysis emphasizes data exploration, key metric generation, and a reproducible analytical workflow to support data-driven decision-making in credit approval processes.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
**General Objective**

To analyze customer data in order to understand the key factors influencing credit scores and banking credit risk.

**Specific Objectives**

- Identify the most relevant variables associated with credit risk
- Analyze credit score distributions across different customer profiles
- Examine delinquency patterns and repayment capacity
- Generate actionable insights to support credit approval decisions

## 🏦 Business Context

Financial institutions rely on credit scoring and risk analytics to reduce default risk, comply with regulatory requirements, and improve profitability. A robust data analysis framework enables customer segmentation, consistent risk evaluation, and standardized decision-making based on quantitative evidence rather than subjective criteria.
